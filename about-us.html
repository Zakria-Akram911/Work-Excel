            <h3>Dan Feerst Daniel Feerst About us WorkExcel</h3>
            <p>Daniel Feerst owns WorkExcel.com and is President of DFA Publishing & Consulting, LLC and located near
                Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
            <p>Formerly, WorkExcel.com was called EAPtools.com until we broadened the scope of our products to better
                serve human resource managers and other allied workforce management professionals who are concerned
                about employee behavioral issues in the workplace, reducing related risk, and improving supervisor
                skills.
            </p>
            <p>We started operations in 1994 with the publication of the FrontLine Supervisor newsletter. It is still
                one of our most popular products. The newsletter is an editable, reproducible, and e-mail ready
                publication. Originally intended to educate managers, supervisors, and team leaders in how to use the
                organization's employee assistance program (EAP) as a resource to help employees improve job
                performance, it also offers skills education to help supervisors become better managers of themselves
                and those they supervise. We have written over 1200 questions and answers on the supervisor's role to
                date.</p>
            <p>We offer publications, training products, free informational tools, ideas, and tips to support employers,
                and those who serve employers with the mission of helping employees remain healthy, happy, and
                productive. Our goal is to help employers reduce behavioral risk exposure and the loss of productivity
                that flow from employee behaviors influenced by behavioral health conditions, stress, addictive disease
                and substance abuse, conflict at work, personal troubles, inappropriate and risky behavior, and
                reactions to events like violence, trauma, and loss.</p>
